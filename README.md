### Problem

Due to this COVID-19 pandemic, the entire world has been suffering quite a lot. However, amidst all these, there is a section of society who has been suffering the most. These are the daily wage labours who have lost their source of living

### Our Solution:

In order to avoid such mishaps, we have come up with our application “Wager”.
An overview: 
So we would register all labours onto our platform, asking them to fill the basic details like their name, location of residence with proper verification. And on the client side as well, we would register them onto our platform. 
Now in case, someone requires labours, they can simply post a requirement on the “Wager” mobile application, indicating the location of work, and the number of labours required. 
Our application’s algorithm would make sure that every labour registered on our platform gets a work assignment. For example, X labour has been allotted a work on our application. So, next time, priority would be given to another labour who hasn’t got an opportunity to work. 
The employer would have to deposit the fees of the labourer onto our platform in advance. This would ensure that no false requirements are posted. Once the labour has completed his/her task, the client would give an OTP to the worker that would be generated onto our platform just when the client posts a requirement. Once the worker inputs the correct OTP, given by the client, his/her wage would be transferred to their account.

### Advantages: 

* It would ensure easy hiring of labours, as people would be able to hire labours just by few taps on their mobile phone, instead of contacting a contractor.
* This would increase the wages of labours, as the cost of the contractor in between the customer and the labour would be minimized.
*	If in the future, again some mishap happens, causing the labours to lose their daily source of income, we would have a database of all the daily wage labours along with their bank accounts. So, any help can be directly transferred to their bank accounts.
*	It would prevent favoritism, as would give all the labours a working opportunity, as our algorithm would ensure this.
*	It would normalize the wages, so that people get an idea of the rates of hiring labours for a particular task, based on location.
